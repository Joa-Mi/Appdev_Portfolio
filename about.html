                <!-- Left Side (Empty/Image placeholder if needed, but per design image is implied or maybe hidden effectively? 
                     Actually looking at the screenshot, the "About Me" is centered at top, 
                     then "Dedicated Developer..." is right aligned relative to a big empty space or image.
                     Wait, looking closer at the screenshot:
                     There is a "About me" label on the far left with a small leaf/flower image.
                     The main text is pushed to the right side.
                     
                     Let's check the current about.html. It has an image on left.
                     The user screenshot shows:
                     Left: White space + "About me" text with small graphic? Or is that just a watermark?
                     Right: Content.
                     
                     Actually, re-reading the screenshot 1:
                     Top center: "About Me" with underline.
                     Content is split.
                     Left: Empty? Or maybe the image is missing?
                     Ah, the user provided `uploaded_image_0` which looks like a screenshot of the about page.
                     It shows "About Me" title.
                     Then a large area.
                     Left side has a small "About me" text with a flower.
                     Right side calculates "Dedicated Developer & Problem Solver" and text, and then the grid.
                     
                     I will try to keep the `about-image` div but maybe it needs to be adjusted or the user wants the specific layout.
                     
                     Let's stick to the plan: layout 2 column.
                     Left: Image (I'll keep the existing image placeholder).
                     Right: Text content + Skills Grid.
